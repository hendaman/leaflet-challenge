# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, we have been tasked with developing a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet (specifically earthquakes).

Using d3 to retrieve the data, leaflet is used to plot the map showing each earthquake recorded worldwide over the last week. Each earthquake is marked with size representing magnitude of the earthquake, and colour representing the depth recorded of the earthquake.

To run the code, navigate to the repository in your local files in your terminal and run `python -m http.server` and use localhost:8000 in your local browser to access the map.
